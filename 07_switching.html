      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>WebDriver provides commands for interacting with the
      operating system window containing the current browsing
      context. Because different operating systems, window managers
      provide different abilities, not all of the commands in this
      section can be supported by all remote ends. Where a command is
      not supported, an <a>unsupported operation</a> error is
      returned.</p>

          </table>
        <p>The Get Window Size command returns the size of the
        operating system window corresponding to the <a>current
        top-level browsing context</a>.</p>

        <p>The <a>remote end steps</a> for <dfn>Get Window Size</dfn>
        are:</p>
        <ol>
          <!-- Can this whole operation be unsupported? -->
          <li><p>If the <a>current top level browsing context</a> is <a>no longer open</a>,
              return an error with code <a>no such window</a>.</li>
          <li><p>Let <var>width</var> be the width in CSS pixels of the OS
              window containing the <a>current top-level browsing
              context</a>, including any browser chrome and
              externally drawn window decorations.</li>
          <li><p>Let <var>height</var> be the height in CSS pixels of
          the OS window containing the <a>current top-level browsing
          context</a>, including any browser chrome and any externally
          drawn window decorations.</li>

          <li><p>Let <var>data</var> be a new JSON Object.</li>

          <li><p>Set the property <code>width</code> on <var>data</var>
              to <var>width</var>.</li>

          <li><p>Set the property <code>height</code> on <var>data</var>
              to <var>height</var>.</li>

          <li><p>Return <a>success</a> with data <var>data</var>

        Resizes the OS window currently receiving commands to have the <code>height</code> and <code>width</code> passed in as parameters.
        <p>If a request is made to resize a OS window to a size which cannot be performed (e.g. the browser has a minimum, or fixed OS window size, or the operating system does not support resizing windows at all as is the case in many phone OSs), an <code><a href="#status-unsupported-operation">unsupported operation</a></code> status code MUST be returned.</p>
        <p>After <code>setWindowSize</code>, the browser window MUST NOT be in the maximised state.</p>
        <dl class='parameters'>
          <dt>unsigned double width</dt>
          <dd>The "width" value refer to the javascript <code>window.outerwidth</code> property. If the User Agent does not support this property, it represents the width of the whole OS window including window chrome and window resizing borders/handles.</li></dd>
          <dt>unsigned double height</dt>
          <dd>The "height" value refer to the javascript <code>window.outerheight</code> property. If the User Agent does not support this property, it represents the width of the whole OS window including window chrome and window resizing borders/handles.</li></dd>

        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>The <a>Maximize Window</a> command invokes the window
      manager-specific "maximize" operation, if any, on the window
      containing the <a>current top-level browsing context</a>. This
      typically increases the window to the maximum available size
      without going full-screen.</p>
      <p>The <a>remote end steps</a> for <dfn>Maximise Window</dfn>
        are:</p>
      <ol>
          <li><p>If the <a>current top level browsing context</a>
              is <a>no longer open</a>, return an <a>error</a> with
              code <a>no such window</a>.</li>
          <li><p>If the <a>remote end</a> does not support the
               <a>Maximize Window</a> command for the <a>current top
              level browsing context</a> for any reason, return an
              error with code <a>unsupported operation</a>.</li>
          <li><p>Run the implementation-specific steps to complete the
          <a>Maximize</a> command,
          which should have the effect of maximizing the dimensions of
          the window containing the <a>current active top-level
          browsing context</a> without making the window full-screen, if the
          window manager distinguishes between maximized and
          full-screen windows.</li>
          <li><p>Return <a>success</a> with data null</li>

          <td></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>The <a>Fullscreen Window</a> command invokes the window
      manager-specific "full screen" operation, if any, on the window
      containing the <a>current top-level browsing context</a>. This
      typically increases the window to the size of the physical
      display and can hide browser UI elements such as toolbars.</p>
      <p>The <a>remote end steps</a> for <dfn>Fullscreen Window</dfn>
        are:</p>
      <ol>
          <li><p>If the <a>current top level browsing context</a>
              is <a>no longer open</a>, return an <a>error</a> with
              code <a>no such window</a>.</li>
          <li><p>If the <a>remote end</a> does not support the
               <a>Fullscreen Window</a> command for the <a>current top
              level browsing context</a> for any reason, return an
              error with code <a>unsupported operation</a>.</li>
          <li><p>Run the implementation-specific <a>Fullscreen
          Window</a> steps, which should have the effect of making the
          dimensions of the window containing the <a>current top-level
          browsing context</a> as close as possible to the dimensions
          of the display containing the window dimensions, and may
          hide browser-provided chrome such as toolbars.</li>
          <li><p>Return <a>success</a> with data null</li>
      </ol>
